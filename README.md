Switch Direction
================

A Google Chrome and Firefox extension for Switching Direction in the pages and text edits.

Install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fldkjfjmcadcklboajlnclnfjpdopcce) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switch-direction/).

Chrome has added direction switch on its context menu for some years and there are different hotkeys available for direction switch on Chrome and Firefox which makes this extension/addons not very relevant nowadays. (Right/Left "Control-Shift" on Chrome for Windows and on Firefox, you can enable "bidi.browser.ui" from about:config in order to have access to "Ctrl+Shift+X" for switch direction, if you are unable to do that right now)
