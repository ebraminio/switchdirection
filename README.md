Switch Direction
================

A Google Chrome and Firefox extension for Switching Direction in the pages and text edits.

Install it from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fldkjfjmcadcklboajlnclnfjpdopcce) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switch-direction/).

Chrome, right now, supports direction switch on its context menu and there are different hotkey avaiable for this on Chrome and Firefox which makes this mostly not very relevant nowadays. (On Firefox, you can enable "bidi.browser.ui" from about:config in order to have access to Ctrl+Shift+X for switch direction, if you are unable to do that right now)
